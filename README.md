# Postmaster
Email notifications for ExpressionEngine.
Postmaster is not supported by the original developer, so we're working together to get Postmaster working on EE3.

## Can you help?

Developers can help by submitting pull requests to fix issues.
Non-developers can help by testing code and opening issues.

## How to help

1. Visit the Projects area to look for Issues in teh To Do column that you could fix.
2. Reply to an issue indicating that you're looking into fixing it so we don't duplicate work.
3. Submit a pull request when you're done.

Working together I'm sure we can get this done!
